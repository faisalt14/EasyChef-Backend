# Easy Chef - Phase 2  

This repository represents the second phase of our Easy Chef Project. During this phase, our team implemented the backend of Easy Chef using Django.   

## Project Highlights 

•	**RESTful APIs**: We implemented all user stories by creating one or more REST APIs.   
•	**CRUD Functionality**: Our backend includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) views and serializers to manage effectively.  
•	**Authentication and Authorization**: We enforced authentication and authorization using Token authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access specific parts of the system.  
•	**Pagination**: We implemented pagination for APIs that can potentially return large datasets. This ensures that a reasonable amount of data is fetched in each response, improving efficiency.  

## Documentation 
Comprehensive documentation is available in the docs/doc.pdf file. It provides insights into the following:  

•	**Model Design**: Detailed information about the design of our data models, ensuring a clear understanding of the data structure.  
•	**API Endpoints**: A complete list of API endpoints, along with short descriptions of each, the HTTP methods they support, and the expected payloads.  

## Project Phases
**Phase 1**: Static demo with HTML and CSS.  
**Phase 2**: Implementation of backend server using DJANGO (current phase).  
**Phase 3**: Fully operational website featuring a React frontend server linked to the Django backend.
